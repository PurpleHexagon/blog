Since there was a lot of misinformation being spread relating to COVID19 I decided that I wanted to visualise some of the data available.

I was keen to do this as I wanted to keep an eye on what was happening around me. I was also keen to see if I could compare datasets to try and produce some visualisations to disprove some of the more extreme view points relating to the outbreak, like 5G causing the outbreak etc.

## ObservableHQ and covid19api.com

Being my first time using ObservableHQ, I decided to start simple, so that I could get to know the platform and what was possible. I started out by creating a ObservableHQ notebook consuming the covid19api.com JSON API and created a simple graph in Vega Lite.

You can view this notebook here: https://observablehq.com/d/ed92b04582f8b2e6
