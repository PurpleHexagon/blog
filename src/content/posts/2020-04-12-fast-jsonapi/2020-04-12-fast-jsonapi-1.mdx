When building RESTful APIs I generally try to use build them using a HATEOAS architecture. JSON API is my preferred specification to adhere to, though previously I was often using Hal+json
 but found JSON API to gel with me personally more. I am also keen to try and JSON-LD which looks like it could be a game changer but that's a story for another day and another post.
 
In a recent RoR project I went looking for a good library to use to implement JSON API in my Rails API. After some research I found that a combination of Netflix fast_jsonapi and restful-jsonapi packages was the best route to take.

Whilst the documentation on the Netflix repositories was fairly good to get me started, when I started doing more complex things I was finding I had to dig through the sourcecode and debug it myself. So I decided to document what I have found for my benefit in the future and hopefully others may also find this helpful.

I'm not going to go into the general setup of these libraries as this can already be found in the readme files. The repositories I'm using are https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi and https://github.com/Netflix/restful-jsonapi.

_Example code is taken from an Agritech application I am currently writing._

*__Disclaimer: Since I worked out these techniques myself I am unsure if I am fully using the libraries correctly and to their potential. If anyone works out some better ways to use I'd be interested to hear their techniques.__*

## POSTing data

I used the restful-jsonapi library to capture user input from POST request body.

I wanted to be able to send POST requests with the following body to be able to create a farm resource, create a relationship with an existing company and create a new related field resource.

```json
{
	"data": {
		"attributes": {
			"name": "My Farm",
			"description": "Farm 1",
		},
		"relationships": {
	      "company": {
	        "data": {"id": "1"}
	      },
	      "fields": {
	      	"data": [
	      		{
	      		"attributes": {
	    			"name": "Top Field",
	    			"description": "You know the big at the top.",
	    		}
	      	}]
	      }
	    }
	}
}
```

I found the follow controller code was required to achieve this:

```ruby
class FarmsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_farm, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  # POST /farms
  def create
    @farm = Farm.new(farm_params_jsonapi)

    respond_to do |format|
      if @farm.save
        format.html { redirect_to @farm, notice: 'Farm was successfully created.' }
        format.json {
          options = {}
          options[:is_collection] = false

          render json: FarmSerializer.new(@farm, options).serialized_json
        }
      else
        errors = fetch_errors(@farm)

        format.html { render :new }

        format.json {
          render json: RequestErrorSerializer.new(errors).serialized_json,
                 status: :unprocessable_entity
        }
      end
    end
  end

  private
    # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
    def set_farm
      @farm = Farm.find(params[:id])
    end

    def farm_params
      params[:include] ||= []

      params.permit([include: []], [page: [:number, :size]], :id, :all)
    end

    def farm_params_jsonapi
      restify_param(:farm).require(:farm)
                          .permit(
                            :id,
                            :name,
                            :description,
                            :company_id,
                            fields_attributes: [
                                :id,
                                :name,
                                :description,
                            ],
                            fields: [
                                :id,
                                :name,
                                :description,
                            ],
                            relationships: []
                          )
    end

    def fetch_errors
      errors = []
        entity.errors.each do |key, value|
          errors << Error.new(key, value)
        end

      return errors
    end
end
```

The library will transform the data so that nested related data will be flattened and the property will be appended with '_attributes'.

In order to have new records created automatically I found I needed to add the following to my rails model.

```ruby
class Farm
  def fields_attributes=(fieldsData)
    self.fields = Field.create(fieldsData)
  end
end
```

Having to add the '_attributes' property to the params hash and having to then add a method to my models was not how I was hoping this would work. But I personally couldn't find a better way to do this so far and decided that since this worked I would crack on with actually building my API.

### Serializers

For transformering and serializing data from a Ruby object to JSON in the correct data shape I used fast_jsonapi.

An example of a serailizer:

```ruby
class FarmSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :id
  attributes :name
  attributes :description
  has_many :fields
end
```

An example of this class in use can be seen above in the controller codeblock. The code is fairly simple, just need to include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer then define attributes and relationships much like a Rails Model.

## Paging

Pagination can be done the following way ...

## Included

JSON API has the ability to switch between including relationships when you make a GET request and not including them.

## Managing Errors

To manage errors I created a an error serializer and a method to build up

error.rb
```ruby

class Error
  attr_accessor :detail, :title

  @detail = []
  @title = []

  def initialize(title, detail)
    @title = title
    @detail = detail
  end
end
```

request_error_serializer.rb
```ruby
class RequestErrorSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ErrorSerializer

  attributes :title, :detail
end
```

error_serializer.rb
```ruby
require 'fast_jsonapi'

module FastJsonapi::ErrorSerializer
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    attr_accessor :with_root_key

    include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
    set_id :title

    def initialize(resource, options = {})
      super
      @with_root_key = options[:with_root_key] != false
    end

    def hash_for_one_record
      logger.info super[:data]
      serialized_hash = super[:data]&[:attributes]
      return !with_root_key ? serialized_hash : {
          errors: serialized_hash
      }
    end

    def hash_for_collection
      serialized_hash = super[:data]&.map{|err| err[:attributes]}
      return !with_root_key ? serialized_hash : {
          errors: serialized_hash
      }
    end
  end
end
```
