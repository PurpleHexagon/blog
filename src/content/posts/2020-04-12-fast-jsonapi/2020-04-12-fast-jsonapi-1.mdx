I often use the JSON API specification when building APIs. Previously I was often using Hal+json
 but found JSON API to be much better.
 
In a recent RoR project I went looking for a good library to use to implement JSON API in my Rails API. After some research I found that a combination of Netflix fast_jsonapi and restful-jsonapi packages was the best route to take.

Whilst the documentation on the Netflix repositories was fairly good to get me started, when I started doing more complex things I was finding I had to dig through the sourcecode and debug it myself.

So I decided to document what I have found for my benefit in the future and hopefully others may also find this helpful. 

Full disclaimer since I worked out these techniques myself I am unsure if I am fully using the library correctly. If anyone works out some better ways to use I'd be interested to hear their techniques.

## POSTing data

I used the restful-jsonapi library to capture user input from POST request body. a


```ruby
class Farm
  def fields_attributes=(fieldsData)
    self.fields = Field.create(fieldsData)
  end
end
```


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```js
const some = {}
```
